# Open-source 3D vector maps in the browser

## A demonstration of using terrain and vector tiles

This presentation aims to explore the possibilities of using open-source mapping tools, specifically MapLibre GL JS, QGIS, and PMTiles, in combination with LiDAR point cloud elevation data to create dynamic and detailed 3D maps with terrain tile sets. Attendees will discover the capabilities of MapLibre GL JS for rendering interactive maps and learn how to integrate LiDAR data to visualize terrain in high fidelity. The session will include demonstrations, code examples, and discussions on leveraging these tools to build immersive and informative 3D mapping applications.
